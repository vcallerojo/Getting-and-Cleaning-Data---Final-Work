This repo contains the final assignment of the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" by Johns Hopkins University.
It can be found:
 - finaldataset.txt, the final dataset,
 - run_analysis.R, the script in R programmed to achieve it
 - Codebook.txt explaining how it is done and the content of the dataset.

The data for the project can be downladed from this link:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Once downloaded the starting dataset, the R script called run_analysis.R can be run to achieve the next points:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
